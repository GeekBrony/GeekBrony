## Current Project: PoniGame
In 2018, I started development on PoniGame, an MMO Sandbox with pastel ponies.

This is a personal project that I have been passionately + diligently working on as a way to learn and understand the software development lifecycle in games.
In the future, I plan to use this knowledge as a stepping stone for my career as a Software Engineer.

As a Backend Developer, I am responsible for:
- Developing the game's backend service architecture to scale.
- Developing and maintaining a custom .NET network serialization framework.
- Designing a PostgreSQL database from scratch using Entity Framework Core (Code-First)
